            this possible you need to store somewhere links (bookmarks) to such resources. The paper on which you have written down a link
            will be lost immediately. Use of the browser to store links is uncomfortable. Everytime
            search for the desired link using of Google is tedious. So what to do?

            Internet resources. In addition you can place on a page the headlines that are
            published by the most prominent news agencies of the world. News will be automatically updated

    <h5 id="pageStructure">Page structure</h5>
    <section class="help-section">
        <p>
            A page consists of its own properties, such as name and title and may also include
            columns, rows and links (bookmarks). Columns and rows can be hierarchically nested allowing
            creating pages of any complexity. Pages, columns and links can include images and descriptions
            which can be hidden or visible.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each page has a unique Interenet address that ends with
            your user name and a page name. For example, if your login is "mylogin" and a name of the page is "mypage"
            the address of the page will be https://linksnews.org/pages/mylogin/mypage. If you publish your page
            it will be available at this address to any Internet user. The page will be displayed in the
            <a href="#" [routerLink]="['/categories/all']">categories</a> you specify.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to put links or news on a page you need to add at least one column to the page first.
            A page can contain up to twelve columns. You can specify a title and a description for each column
            as well as upload an image. A column can contain links, news or rows. In the simplest case you create
            a column and add links to it or specify a source of the news. If you want to create a more complex column containing
            for example links and news you should add two rows to a column first. Then you add a column with links to one row and
            a column with news to other row. As well as a page a row can contain up to twelve columns.

                is "Links". Do not change it. Select a "View mode", "List" or "Tile". If desired you can upload an

                which will be displayed on the page. For example, if you create a link to the Google website type in "Google".
                Set the address of the link. The easiest way to do this is to go to the website on the Internet
                for which you are creating the link and copy the adderss for the site from the browser's address bar, and then
                paste the copied URL into the "Address" field. In this case it is "http://google.com". Click "Save". The window closes
                and a link title will be displayed inside the link edited.
            </li>
            <li>
                To complete the creation of the page choose <i class="fa fa-file-text-o fa-ajust" aria-hidden="true"></i>
                "Page" -> "Leave edit mode". Page will leave edit mode
                and enter browse mode. Now you can use the created links to go to the corresponding Internet pages.

            You cannot edit this page but you can remove it from the list of your pages. If the page's author updates the page
            changes will be visible to you. And "Copy to My pages" means to make a copy of the page and put it in the list
            your pages. You can use the copy the same way as you use your other own pages.
