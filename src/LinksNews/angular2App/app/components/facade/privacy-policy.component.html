        <h5>Security</h5>
        <section>

            <p>
                We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information
                is protected both online and offline.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted
                to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or
                looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the web page.
            </p>
            <p>
                While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline.
                Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are
                granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable
                information are kept in a secure environment.
            </p>

            <h5>Registration</h5>
            <p>
                In order to create own pages a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to
                give certain information (such as name and email address). This information is used to contact you about the services
                on our site in which you have expressed interest. At your option, you may also provide demographic information
                (such as gender or age) about yourself, but it is not required.
